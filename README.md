This is an API that I made for a homeless shelter, It's made in Python, CSS, and HTML. 
This is just the overview of non-sensitive information to prove my skills in making effective websites with many fields of interest.
This is the safe half of the website to purely express my skills in HTML + CSS

Run with main.py
